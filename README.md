# rrp-analysis-qld
This project aims to analyse quarterly regional reference price (RRP) for the QLD region.

Refer to the RRP_analysis.py file for quarterly electricity prices for Queensland (QLD), exploring trends and variability over time, with a focus on distinct periods: Evening Peak, Solar Period, and Morning Peak. It includes data visualisation through time series plots, boxplots, and descriptive statistics to identify patterns, anomalies, and insights relevant to price behaviour across these periods.

Refer to RRP_analysis.pdf for comprehensive insights and detailed analysis.
